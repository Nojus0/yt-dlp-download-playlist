# Playlist Script
Script that download's a youtube playlist with `yt-dlp` preserves tracks metadata, transforms the thumbnail to _1:1_ aspect ratio, and embeds it as the track's cover image. 

# Platform
Works both on _Windows_ and _Linux_, just make sure you have yt-dlp and ffmpeg installed and added to _Path_.
